            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVery Creature being born of corrupted nature, hath that ≈øpirit in him that lu≈øts enviou≈øly again≈øt God, and that ≈øeed in him, and growing up with him, which daily ≈øeeks to en≈ønare his Soul further into wickedne≈øs and vanity, and to increa≈øe his ≈øeparation from God, by drawing in iniquity, and filling the Temple where God ≈øhould dwell and be known, with the accur≈øed things which God hates and cannot behold; for this evil ≈øeed being ≈øubtile and forward, prevails above the pure Life, and leads out the mind from it into many ≈øeveral temptations, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting them with delight unto the carnal part, and outward ≈øences, whereby the Seed of God becomes continually vailed and hid from the creature, ≈øo that man knows not that Word of Life by which he was created, nor can he come to be guided by it in him≈øelf, till the head of this evil ≈øeed be brui≈øed, through believing in that Light which comes from the Life, by which the World was made; and this is that Rock which follows man with its unchangeable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony, bearing witne≈øs onely to that which is of him≈øelf, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all the wayes of that evil ≈øeed, calling and reproving the World becau≈øe thereof, which call as many as receives and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to, by Faith comes to hear the Word of Life, wherein Power is received to become the Sons of God; which Power of Life, as it ari≈øes in the Promi≈øed Seed, the head of the evil ≈øeed is brui≈øed, and he comes to be brought under, who had taken the Soul captive at his will to every vain and evil work: and ≈øo as the Creature comes to be redeemed from under the power of darkne≈øs, ≈øo he comes to be guided in the Light of that Life by which he came into the World; and that Light which before reproved him for his deeds of darkne≈øs (following him from one to another, condemning him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62428:3"/>
in all, being turned to by Faith and Obedience) now becomes his Leader out of the World, to the Son of God, in whom Gods Righteou≈øne≈øs is revealed from above<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> to ju≈øtification; which Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs being received into, and abiding in, ≈øin is remembred no more: and thus man being changed into that Nature which changeth not in the inward man, comes to love that Light which before he could not, for no man can love that which is of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he hath received Gods love.</p>
            <p>Now the Light of the World, is Gods love to the World; for God ≈øo loved the World when it was in the power of darkne≈øs, that he gave his Son into the World, a Covenant of Light, that who≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever followeth him ≈øhould not abide in darkne≈øs, but ≈øhould have the Light of Life; Now Gods Love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> in the light of the World, That's his Covenant with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>d, which who≈øoever rejects and receives not, is out of Gods love, and in the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, out of Gods Covenant, neither can he in that ≈øtate believe that Gods love is in it. And this is the cau≈øe why all men ≈øpeak evil of the Light, who love their evil deeds, and cannot receive it as Gods Love, and the way to life, to ≈øuch it is condemnation; not that it was intended thereto; but men loving darkne≈øs rather then light, it becomes condemnation; but to him that believes, and is obedient, to him it is precious: for who follows it out of the World, there receives the Nature of Sons, and the Love of the Father, which the World cannot receive, and the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, and Trea≈øure of eternal Life; and this is not given to any till they come out of the World, as he is not of the World, for therein ≈øtands Gods Covenant with <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed for ever.</p>
            <p>So Gods Love to the World (while men are in that corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Witne≈øs of the Spirit of Truth) is to reprove the World of ≈øin, and te≈øtifie condemnation again≈øt the deeds thereof; but to ≈øuch as have received it, it's a Leader, Comforter, and Saviour; and this is the cau≈øe why the one loves, and the other hates, each Nature ≈øpeaking that ≈øtate in which it ≈øtands towards God, and as it hath obtained from him in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, love or condemnation; and he that will not receive Gods love that calls him out, mu≈øt abide under the power of the ≈øeed which God hates; and this is he that ≈øeeks to murther him that is in Gods love, the evil one having power to blind that mind (who denies the Light)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62428:3"/>
≈øo far, till he cannot ≈øee that the Murtherer is of the Divel, but thinks he is doing God ≈øervice; and this in the end hath ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen ≈øuch Profe≈ø≈øors as reject the Light of the World, for he that walks in darkne≈øs knows not whither he goes; but God is Light, and in him is no darkne≈øs at all, nor hath darkne≈øs any fellow≈øhip with him: here is known the Children of God, and the children of darkne≈øs; he that loves the Light, brings his deeds to the Light, and hath fellow≈øhip with God in his deeds, and this works the Work of God; and he that denies the Light, works in darkne≈øs, and cannot believe the Power that is in the Light, being under the power of darkne≈øs.</p>
            <p>And therefore he that is born after the fle≈øh, knows not him that is born after the Spirit of Light, nor can judge of his wayes, which are ≈øtrange and wonders in his carnal ≈øight, neither knows he by what power and love that is, by which he overcomes the World, and takes plea≈øure in denying the plea≈øures thereof, and vanqui≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all its vanities out of the heart and mind, and can no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the World, nor make merry with its mirth; but rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the Truth, and is made glad with that which ≈øaves him from ≈øuch folly; the wicked knows not the life of the Righteous, nor the ≈øpring whence his Virtues ari≈øe, nor the power of his Change, nor the end of all his patient ≈øufferings and tryals, but ≈øtands won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at it as folly and madne≈øs; that eye being blinded by the god of this world, which ≈øhould give the ≈øight thereof, and that ≈øeed in bondage under the prince of darkne≈øs, which ≈øhould give to inherit that immortal Trea≈øure; and this mu≈øt be, till there be a denying and coming out of the World to receive that inheritance of divine Light and under≈øtanding, which none can receive, nor be one withal, but as they come out of the world from under that ≈øeed of enmity which ≈øeeks to pervert all the right wayes of God, and wre≈øt all his gifts to mans de≈øtruction as far as he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
            <p>Now this de≈øtroyer or ≈øeed of enmity again≈øt the Life of man, and his Salvation, is kept from that ≈øudden effecting his purpo≈øe upon the creature in whom he is head, by no other thing, but the patience and long-≈øufferings of God, who willing that none of his Creatures ≈øhould peri≈øh, but that if by any means all might hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Truth, and ≈øo recover them≈øelves out of the ≈ønares of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62428:4"/>
this ≈øubtile deceiver and be ≈øaved; wherefore he doth many times long bear and forbear with much patience, and diligence, ≈øtriving by the Spirit of Truth, upon all occa≈øions, when ever the Creature doth but mind it, checking, and reproving, and warning, even many times, at that very in≈øtant when the act of ≈øin is committing; and if the evil one have got ≈øuch power in the creature, that he will not ≈øuffer him to mind reproof before, nor in the act of ≈øin, then afterwards when the heat of temptation is cooled, then he ≈øhews the evil and danger of ≈øuch wickedne≈øs, that ≈øo he might pre≈øerve fear in him again≈øt the next temptation. And thus (in many) he keeps back de≈øtruction a long time, ≈øo that ≈øome are long ere the wicked one get them to fill up their mea≈øure; and ≈øome in that time of Gods patient forbearing and ≈øuffering, come to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and turn to that which reproves, and are ≈øaved; and others go on to de≈øtruction, which ≈øwiftly they draw upon them≈øelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter once the Spirit hath cea≈øed ≈øtriving and reproving; for then the fear is lo≈øt, and the evil one hath his liberty at his own will, (the Creature being given up of the Lord, and the Spirit of Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly departed) nought but deceit is left to guide him who hath dealt deceitfully with the Spirit of Truth, which at the be≈øt hath but a form of godline≈øs without the Power; for the Power of God is in that Spirit, and in that Life which is known, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the evil one, which is fallen and covered in ≈øuch, in whom death reigns; only ≈øuch who are born of the Spirit, have the Life and Power, and know its ≈øtrength and virtue unto eternal Salvation; the re≈øt are left to their thoughts and notions.</p>
            <p>And here is the cau≈øe of that ≈øtrong contention that hath ever been betwixt the Children of Light, who are born of that Spirit of Truth, and have their light and ≈øtrength in the inward man; and the worlds profe≈ø≈øors, who≈øe expectation ≈øtands in ≈øomething with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, which others have ≈øpoken of who had it in them; and ≈øo not knowing the Power and My≈øtery of the living Faith, which is holden in a pure Con≈øcience, which only hath the Call and Power to bring out of the worlds darkne≈øs, they are kept captive therein, contending again≈øt the Spiritual Light; and ≈øo while they are in the world, go about to comprehend and mea≈øure that Spirit of Truth, which the world cannot receive, neither knoweth, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Spirit of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> to have no other op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

who are led out of the world, and born thereof, and in whom Chri≈øt lives, than they find it to have in them≈øelves, who ≈øtumble at it, and are di≈øobedient and unbelieving in heart; when as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to us that believe, it is Elect and Precious who come to it for all ≈øupplies; but to the wi≈ødom and profe≈ø≈øion of the world, it is a Rock of offence, and ≈øtumbling-≈øtone, yet is it the Head of the Corner; and in them who revile it and reject it, it is become all they have in them that is good, true, and faithful towards God, or their Souls, as their hearts in ≈øecret do witne≈øs to them, and leaves them without excu≈øe many times.</p>
            <p>For even they that reject this Light and Spirit, have nothing el≈øe that can ≈øhew them ≈øo much as one of their thoughts, or divide to their under≈øtanding the evil from the good, either in Thought, Word, or Action, or that can really ≈øhew them what is of God really, and what is of him, who doth but ≈øhew him≈øelf to be God to deceive withal, and is not; nor without it can they perceive the ≈øeveral motions of every ≈øeveral ≈øpirit that is in them, to receive the good, and deny the bad; nor can they know the ≈øeveral roots of Life and Death, which plant to pluck up, and which to feed on; and how can ≈øuch labour in Gods Vineyard? And indeed, without this Light the Body is a hou≈øe of darkne≈øs, and a habitation of every deceitful ≈øpirit, and the heart de≈øperately wicked, and no man knows it, but he in whom the Light of Truth ≈øhineth; and he that declares to man his thoughts, his Name is the <hi>Lord of Ho≈øts.</hi> Thus is he the Head of the Corner, which the ≈øtumbler cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in his wit, and ≈øo rejects him, without whom there is no building, nor working the Work of God.</p>
            <p>And therefore you ≈øons of the darkne≈øs of this World, mind in your ≈øelves what it is you ≈øet your ≈øelves again≈øt; is it not that Light which would limit and chain the evil one in you, that which condemns you for every evil work, ≈øecret and open, which will not let you be proud and wanton, and lu≈øtful? that which in your own hearts te≈øtifies again≈øt you for deceit and fal≈øhood towards God, and towards men, deceit in Religion, hypocri≈øie and fal≈øhood, making a form of what you are not? deceit in your dealing with men, in your tradings and ≈øpeakings, and ≈øeverall actings, both as Rulers, Prie≈øts and People, without re≈øpect of per≈øons, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing? but hath re≈øpect onely to that of God in you, which is

of his Nature, given to you to guide man in the Light of God, out of all the wayes of this deceiving ≈øpirit.</p>
            <p>And now he that comes to you with this Doctrine, comes near you, being manife≈øt in Spirit to that of God in your own hearts, you are pricked therewith, and then the evil one is ≈øtirred up in you, to fight again≈øt that which is Truth in your ≈øelves, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwers to the Truth which is ≈øpoken to you, by another without you, from the ≈øame Spirit of Truth, which by you is rejected; And thus you joyning with him that ri≈øes up in wrath again≈øt the Truth in your ≈øelves, and denying that which ≈øhould chain and bind the evil one, you deny the Lord of Life, and give ≈øtrength to the evil one to murther the Ju≈øt in you, and quench the Spirit of Truth, and weary the Lord with ≈øtriving, till you be given up wholly to the power of darkne≈øs, who will then keep you ≈øeeking Salvation without, while≈øt he is heaping up evil within.</p>
            <p>For that which ≈øeeks to devour your Souls is within you, whil≈øt he is leading you out to ≈øeek Salvation; and nought can damn you, but what is in you: ≈øin is within before it be acted, ≈øo mu≈øt Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be within before you be clean≈øed; though the old deceiver hath taught people to think they are ≈øaved by believing God at a di≈øtance, who neither know nor wor≈øhip him in the Spirit and Truth, nor are their bodies his Temples, nor can the Holy One dwell or walk in them, becau≈øe of uncleanne≈øs, but their Ve≈ø≈øels being filled with all the powers of darkne≈øs, and the heavenly Place with Spiritual wickedne≈øs, hath cau≈øed God to depart from the children of men for this uncleanne≈øs; and yet a Lyar ≈øpeaks Peace, and preaches Salvation, and the Creature believes ≈øo, being filled with darkne≈øs: But the Children of Light receive not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who ≈øee and feel, and cannot be content with words, but with power. A talk of God ≈øatisfies not the Soul of a good man, till he feel his Pre≈øence and Power; God without, and the Devil within, is not the Saints Faith nor Salvation; but God in them, and the Devil ca≈øt out, is their glory and ≈øtrength, and they are bold through the might of his Spirit in them, to war daily again≈øt the Prince of this world, becau≈øe they know him who is greater in them and more holy, than he that is in the world. And this is the Faith-that overcomes the world; and he that's born of the Spirit, hath the Father and the Son, and he that hath the Devil is his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62428:5"/>
and knows him not whence he is, but judgeth him after the fle≈øh and outward appearance; but the Child of Light wars not after the fle≈øh, but after God, that he alone may have the glory, who is all in them that they have to glory in, who gives their ≈øouls the holy victory.</p>
            <p>And now, were not you wholly blind in your minds, and pa≈øt feeling, you could never ≈øit down ≈øo be≈øotted, as to believe you are ≈øaved, while you are daily captivated in ≈øin, and forced many times to do that which you know you ≈øhould not, and this by the power of lu≈øt in you, enti≈øing and leading you into every tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cau≈øing to fall into many hurtful evils, which gathers ≈øtrength and rooting daily in you, heaping wrath and vengeance, by adding ≈øin unto ≈øin, which mu≈øt all be accounted for in the end thereof, when you have filled your ve≈ø≈øels to a full mea≈øure; And can you ≈øay you are redeemed from the Devil, while he hath this power in you, that you are not able to re≈øi≈øt him, but are led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at his will, contrary to all fear of God, or power of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs?

            <p>And as many as are quickned with the Spirit of Life, have the feeling of this before they bring forth the fruits thereof into the world, and are come to the di≈øcerning of things that differ in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and effect, by the ta≈øting and handling of the Word of Life, and knowledge of that Election which is before the World was, by which they are made able to judge the ground and end of every motion in them, or to them; which abiding in, they need not man to teach them, neither can they be deceived; which makes them with boldne≈øs bring forth openly ≈øuch words and works as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in them by the Word of Life, which ≈øhews the whole World to lie in wickedne≈øs, and makes it manife≈øt in the Light of Life, by whom the Prince of<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> this World is judged and condemned, and the ≈øecrets of hearts made manife≈øt, according to the nature of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øeveral ≈øpirit, which comes up to the day of the Lord's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

               <p>THE Spirit of Life which is in <hi>Chri≈øt Je≈øus,</hi> by whom the World was made in the beginning, hath a Law that is Spiritual, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from him≈øelf; which Law gives light in ≈øpirit to good and bad, te≈øtifying again≈øt the power of ≈øin and death; which Light, as many as receive by faith and obedience, are brought thereby under the Law of Life, which whoever is faithful in, are led in ≈øuch wayes, whereby that part in man in which the Law of ≈øin hath its power, is crucified and ≈ølain, and the Seed of the Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by comes to its right freedom, which by the man of ≈øin is kept in bondage, while the ≈øtrong man keeps the hou≈øe, who≈øe ≈øtrength is in ≈øuch things as the carnal mind takes plea≈øure in; which things the Law of the Spirit calls them from, who mind it in the Light thereof, and leads to exerci≈øe the mind in ≈øpiritual things, and to feed on the Word of Life, whereby the inward man is ≈øtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made to grow up into the ≈øtature of a ≈øpiritual man, filled thereby with ≈øpiritual power, life and vertue, to bring forth unto God, and to live to him, as the other lived to the fle≈øh and brought forth unto death.</p>

born of Freedom; And the fle≈øhly ≈øpirit it draws, and ≈øaith Come, holding forth vi≈øible Idols to take the carnal affections, and to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the mind from the Spirit of Life into carnal objects, who promi≈øe much to the eye of earthly wi≈ødom, and have a likene≈øs of a ≈øub≈øtance in them, but the end is death, and the whole life is captivity to vanity, and eternal ≈øeparation from God; And here are the Children of Freedom, which are in Chri≈øt Je≈øus made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt to the world, by their coming out of it; and the children of bondage manife≈øt, who cannot deny to ≈øerve it; and betwixt the≈øe two is no agreement: for he that is a ≈øervant of ≈øin, is free from Righteou≈øne≈øs, &amp; the Servant of Righteou≈øne≈øs is free from ≈øin, and as he that is in the fle≈øh cannot plea≈øe God, neither can he that is in the Spirit plea≈øe the world: the≈øe are children of ≈øeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and ≈øeveral Natures; And he that's born after the fle≈øh hath that ≈øpirit which lu≈øteth enviou≈øly, and ≈øeeks to devour the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he that's born again after the Spirit of Life, is brought into the re≈øtoration, as in the beginning, and bringeth forth to God the Fruits of eternal Life and Salvation in the Creation.</p>
               <p>And as by the Creatures yeelding and con≈øenting to the ≈øubtile one, the life is lo≈øt, and the evil ≈øeed gets ≈øtrength in man to rule and bring forth after the power of darkne≈øs; So by the Creatures believing in the Light, and by yeelding to the motions of the Life of Holine≈øs, and the Law thereof, comes the evil ≈øeed to lo≈øe its ≈øtrength and feeding, which is upon carnal things; and that Life which is by Faith hearing, comes again to be renewed in the Ve≈ø≈øel, and ari≈øes through the Spirit, and reigns above death; and the Righteou≈øne≈øs and Virtue of that Life is not of the nature of fle≈øh and blood, but of God; and is made manife≈øt in the earthen Ve≈ø≈øel, by the Life and Power of the Spirit, again≈øt the will of the fle≈øh, and the lu≈øts thereof: And thus comes man again into the Re≈øtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Redemption of the body, into the free ≈øervice of that Spirit and Life, of whom it is the off-≈øpring, and for which, and by which it came into the world; and here is true reconciliation and peace with God, and no condemnation, but unity in Spirit and Life as the Father and Son are one, the lu≈øt being ≈ølain, the enticer denyed, and the accu≈øer ca≈øt out, and all things become new, and all things of God; here is no more the hou≈øe of bondage to ≈øin, but the glorious liberty of the Sons of God; that Nature

being quickned that is Spiritual, it doth not feed on carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, but upon God; ≈øo the inward man becomes a natural Branch of the holy Root, and a Plant of the living God, bringing out freely what the Root ≈øends forth, in which God is glorified, and the Ve≈ø≈øel made Honourable, and the Soul filled with Peace and fatne≈øs, and hath no more ≈øorrow and death to oppre≈øs it; And the Light and Life which is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, manife≈øt in the Spirit of Truth, is the fir≈øt and la≈øt in this work; and here is ≈øeen how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural man, driven from God, is become, to that pure Life which gives him breath and being, and would pre≈øerve him from de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who is ≈øo wholly fallen from it, and become contrary to it, in nature and judgment, that of all things in the world its the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt cro≈øs to be guided by that Light which ari≈øes in him from that holy Life, and daily calls him in Spirit thereinto, being degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into a contrary nature, more ≈øubtile and ≈øelfi≈øh, is willing to joyn with the enemy thereof in any way again≈øt the pure Light that's in him≈øelf, it to revile, reproach, murther and turn into darkne≈øs, by covering it with deceit; though man in this ≈øtate hath nothing in him but it, that is of the Nature of God, Holy and Ju≈øt, or that will call him from the paths of the de≈øtroyer, into the way of <hi>Life,</hi> or bring forth through him any Fruits of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or ≈øpiritual Wor≈øhip that God will own; nor hath he any other thing in this world that is alwayes pre≈øent with him, to give him to ≈øee when he is inticed with his lu≈øts, and tempted to ≈øin, nor the way how to e≈øcape the temptation; yet is man ≈øo exalted in the contrary nature, that he hath forgotten his Creator, and lifts up the heel again≈øt the reproof of his Spirit, trampling upon the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motions of the Holy One, and the Law which out of his mouth proceeds, counting the Light and virtue of his Life to be a low and contemptible thing, not able to ≈øave.

               <p>Wherefore if you love the appearance of Chri≈øt Je≈øus, you mu≈øt not love ≈øin, but in that principle which would not ≈øin, feel him that ≈øuffers becau≈øe of ≈øin, and yet is without ≈øin, and again≈øt ≈øin, and if to him you come, who≈øe appearance is in that which is holy, ju≈øt, and true, and therein joyn to him, you will love that which condemns ≈øin, by which he is grieved &amp; oppre≈ø≈øed; and then are you for Chri≈øt, when you can feel and ≈øuffer with him, by that which he

≈øuffers; and you will then ≈øee that nought is it that is offended at ≈øin being judged, but he that is guilty thereof,</p>

               <head>Grace received, and Grace rejected.</head>
               <p>THE Grace of God is that which brings Salvation to man, all men being in natural darkne≈øs, as they are in the world without God, ≈øo the Grace of God is tendred to all without re≈øpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons; And that's it in every man which gives him a ≈øight of Truth in him≈øelf, which Truth God by his Grace accepts in every man, who would have all men to come to the knowledge thereof, that they might be ≈øaved. Now this Grace in it ≈øelf is one in every man, and is of God in every man, and doth not ≈øpare the evil, nor deny the good in any, out of re≈øpect either to per≈øon, wi≈ødom, ≈øtrength or riches which is of this world, but hath re≈øpect to the Truth of Spirit in all, and their obedience thereto; therein to teach and lead to Salvation, and the true Wor≈øhip of God in Spirit, which leads to Life eternal, and to the ≈øtrengthening the holy Seed in man, quickening the Soul which by ≈øin hath ≈øuffered; and this it doth by condemning ≈øin in every motion, that it may never ari≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the holy Seed, and al≈øo by mini≈øtring comforts and promi≈øes, and power in ≈øpirit to the ≈øoul in the way of its ari≈øing above the power of the ≈øon of wickedne≈øs, ≈øtill mini≈øtring light and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding in the hidden part to the holy Seed that hates ≈øin, opening that eye daily through the obedience of Truth, which the god of this world hath blinded, and purifying the Soul by putting off the body of corruption, and blinding him that ≈øaith he ≈øees, but knows not the way out of ≈øin, mini≈øtring the Law upon him.</p>
               <p>And this is the mini≈øtration of free Grace to every Soul that receives it; and this it worketh powerfully in all that abide in it, through the Spirit of Chri≈øt Je≈øus; and <hi>this Grace</hi> (as ≈øaith the Scripture) <hi>hath appeared to all men;</hi> yea, and doth daily appear in all who truly wait in Spirit for its appearance, and gives to all ≈øuch a ≈øight of Truth in them≈øelves, te≈øtifying with or again≈øt every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their hearts, according as it ≈øtands in the ≈øight of God, whether it be good or evil, whereby the Con≈øcience doth accu≈øe or excu≈øe, even as God ≈øhall judge them by Chri≈øt Je≈øus; So that there is no cau≈øe in this Grace, why any are not ≈øaved thereby from ≈øin and condemnation, but being rejected of ≈øome, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

their condemnation; and the ≈øame thing which ≈øaves him that receives it in faith and obedience, condemns him that rejects it in his di≈øobedience; And this is the Grace of God that changeth not, which appears to all men, but only reigns to Salvation through righteou≈øne≈øs, wherein it is believed to be ≈øufficient and obeyed, in the Truth therewith made manife≈øt.</p>
               <p>So that is the Grace of God, which is of God in man, mini≈øtring in Spirit light to the Soul in the mid≈øt of darkne≈øs, mini≈øtring life to that which is dead in ≈øin; leading that through the vail of death up to God, from whom the Grace hath appeared, and of whom it is; and the Light thereof is Judgement, and di≈øcerning in every one that receives it to be led with it in Judgment, and Condemnation to ≈øuch as turn it into la≈øciviou≈øne≈øs, denying the life thereof, and the truth that leads thereto, and ≈øo cannot be ≈øaved through it; but he that receives it, and joyns to it in Spirit, becomes one with it, and by his daily ≈øinking into it in coun≈øel, it grows in him, and he in it, until it becomes a habitation and cover for him again≈øt all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and ≈øo he becomes gracious in words and works, daily receiving Grace for Grace of his fulne≈øs.</p>
               <p>And he that hath received of this Grace, and is faithful therein, mu≈øt not mini≈øter of it to ≈øtrengthen the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øor, who loves his ≈øin, and ≈øo is under the Law, for that is to ca≈øt the pearls to ≈øwine; but to ≈øuch as are heavy laden and weary of ≈øin, to encourage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt ≈øin and temptations, which all that turn from the Devil mu≈øt be ≈øure to meet with; and Judgement it mini≈øters to the wicked, that therewith he may know his condemnation with the light of Truth, in whom Grace is denied to reign, it is their condemnation, that he is come into the world, who is full of Grace and Truth, but the Kingdom of Grace is Salvation, in whom it reigns through righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs unto eternal Life, by Je≈øus Chri≈øt the Lord.</p>
               <p>So he that receives the teaching of Grace, comes therein to the leading of the Spirit, and ≈øo becomes free from ≈øin, is no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, but under Grace; but the Law hath power over him that walks after the fle≈øh, and every appearance of Grace is witne≈øs again≈øt him, by declaring him to be under the law of ≈øin and death, and not in Covenant with him that appears again≈øt ≈øin in the power of Grace and Truth, which is Chri≈øt Je≈øus the Lord.</p>
